# ICARUS Bigger Stacks Mod

Hate running out of space in your backpack? This mod makes life easier by **raising stack sizes for every stackable item in ICARUS**.  

Instead of carrying 10 wood at a time, you can carry 5000 (or more) depending on the version you pick.

## 🎒 What It Does
- Increases stack sizes for **all items** in the game  
- 7 versions available: **500, 1.000, 2.500, 5.000, 10.000, 25.000, 50.000**  
- Pick the one that fits your playstyle:  
  - Small boost = still some challenge  
  - Huge stacks = almost no inventory juggling  

## ⚙️ Installation
1. For this mod use the Icarus Mod Manager (IMM) from Jimk72.  
2. You have a mod browser inside the mod manager to be able to search & download the wanted version.  
3. Launch the game and enjoy bigger stacks.  

## 🧩 Compatibility
- Works with all stackable items.  
- Shouldn’t conflict with most other mods unless they also change stack sizes.  

## ❓ Troubleshooting
- If stacks don’t change, make sure only **one version** of the mod is installed.  
- Restart the game after adding/removing the mod.  

Enjoy less time managing inventory and more time surviving Icarus! 🌌
