# Zay - All Stacks [10k]

## Description
This mod modifies all stackable items in ICARUS to have a maximum stack size of 10.000 units.

Instead of carrying just a few items at a time, you can now stack up to 10.000 of each item type in a single inventory slot. This significantly reduces inventory management and allows for more efficient resource gathering and storage.

## Compatibility
- Version: 1.2.197
- Compatible with ICARUS week 197+ and future updates
