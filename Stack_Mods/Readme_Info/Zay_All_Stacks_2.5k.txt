# Zay - All Stacks [2.5k]

## Description
This mod modifies all stackable items in ICARUS to have a maximum stack size of 2.500 units.

Instead of carrying just a few items at a time, you can now stack up to 2.500 of each item type in a single inventory slot. This significantly reduces inventory management and allows for more efficient resource gathering and storage.

## Compatibility
- Version: 1.2.201
- Compatible with ICARUS week 201+ and future updates
